        I have provided a JSON structure containing metadata about a database, including tables, views, and procedures. 
        Please analyze the data step by step and return a new JSON structure with the following requirements:

        1. **Database Description**:
        - Provide a brief description of the overall database, including its purpose and primary functions.

        2. **Table Descriptions**:
        For each table, generate:
        - A description summarizing the table's purpose.
        - For each column in the table, provide:
            - A description of its role and significance.
        - Analyze relationships with other tables:
            - Provide descriptions of these relationships, including the cardinality (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-one).

        3. **View Descriptions**:
        For each view, provide:
        - A description of what the view represents.
        - Explain how it relates to the underlying tables and any relevant filters or calculations.

        4. **Output Structure**:
        - Organize the resulting descriptions clearly within a new JSON format, maintaining clarity and conciseness for each description.

        **Processing Steps**:
        Please follow these processing steps while analyzing the JSON data:

        1. **Overall Database Analysis**:
        - Begin with a high-level overview of the database.

        2. **Independent Tables**:
        - Identify and analyze all independent tables first.
        - For each independent table, repeat the description process as outlined.

        3. **Dependent Tables**:
        - Identify dependent tables that relate to the independent ones.
        - Repeat the description process for each dependent table accordingly.

        4. **Views Analysis**:
        - For each view, generate a description based on its definition and context within the database.

        5. **Final Output**:
        - Ensure the final output is in a well-structured JSON format with clear and concise descriptions.
        - IMPORTANT NOTE: For final output maintain the original metadata and combine it with descriptions
        - IMPORTANT NOTE: Return only the JSON structure and avoid any extra commentary, key points, or explanations

        I am providing you with a JSON structure containing metadata about a database, including tables, columns, relationships, and views. Based on this information, please analyze the following user query and generate the corresponding SQL queries.

        It is possible that the query doesn't need any optimization. In that case, return the original query
